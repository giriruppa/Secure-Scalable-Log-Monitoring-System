### 🚀 Project Scope
The objective of this project is to design, develop, and deploy a secure and scalable log monitoring system using Docker containers and Splunk Enterprise. The system automates ingestion, analysis, and alerting for security-centric logs from distributed systems—enhancing visibility, incident detection, and operational efficiency.

### 🔍 Key Focus Areas:
- Centralized Log Monitoring
Aggregation of logs from multiple sources (web servers, applications, authentication services) into a single Splunk instance.

- Docker-Based Deployment
Use of Docker to containerize Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Universal Forwarders, ensuring environment consistency, scalability, and portability.

- Security and Real-Time Alerting
Configuration of alerts for suspicious activity like failed logins, incorrect password attempts, and unauthorized access.

- Scalability
Horizontal scalability by deploying additional forwarders or indexers as needed.

- CI/CD Integration
Automated deployment and updates through Jenkins pipelines for improved reliability and continuous delivery.

- Optional Cloud Integration
Extension to AWS for log storage (S3), identity/access control (IAM), and long-term log analysis.

🛡️ This system aims to be an enterprise-grade, real-time log visibility and threat detection solution across dynamic infrastructures.

### 🧱 System Architecture
The architecture ensures secure, scalable, and automated log monitoring using Docker, Splunk, and CI/CD integration. The components are modular and can be expanded horizontally for performance and reliability.
